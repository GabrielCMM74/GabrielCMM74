# Software Engineer 
I am a Software Engineer with a background in Automation Programming. I have a passion for creating innovative solutions to 
complex problems by taking an abstract approach to roadblocks. While connecting new ideas to realities, I brainstorm in order to break down various elements and implement best practices. 

<br>

- I was a recipient of the Adobe Digital Academy scholarship to support my transition into Software development 
- Before embarking on the path of becoming a software engineer I studied electrical engineering technology, automation systems, PLC/HMI programming, and electrical systems.
